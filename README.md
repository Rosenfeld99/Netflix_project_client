# Netflix Project Frontend 

This project aims to replicate the Netflix user interface, allowing users to browse and watch content in a similar fashion to the real platform. The frontend is built using React.js with Vite for a fast development environment, TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for styling, and Redux for state management. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and key details.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Rosenfeld99/Netflix_project_client.git
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```
Start the development server:

```bash
  npm run dev
```
Build for production:

```bash
  npm run build
```

Hosting for Development 

Before proceeding with Docker setup, make sure the development server is running correctly:

1 Start the development server:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

2 Ensure your package.json includes the following to host the development server:

```bash
  "scripts": {
  "dev": "vite --host 0.0.0.0",
  "build": "vite build",
  "serve": "vite preview"
}
```

## Docker Setup

After verifying the development server runs correctly, proceed with Docker setup:

1 Build Docker Image:

```bash
  docker build -t netflix_project_client:dev .
```
2 Run Docker Container:

```bash
  docker run -p 5173:5173 netflix_project_client:dev
```
This will start the development server inside a Docker container, and you can access the application at http://localhost:5173.

## State Management

Redux is used to manage the global state of the application, including user authentication, screen management, and content browsing.

- Auth Slice: Manages user login, signup, and authentication state
- User Slice: Manages user profile and screen limit state
- Content Slice: Manages movie and TV show data
- Shop Slice Manages products and categories

## Screen Limit

Each user is limited to a maximum of 5 screens. This is managed in the User Slice of the Redux store. If a user tries to add more than 5 screens, they will be notified and prevented from doing so.
