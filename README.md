# Netflix Project Frontend 

This project aims to replicate the Netflix user interface, allowing users to browse and watch content in a similar fashion to the real platform. The frontend is built using React.js with Vite for a fast development environment, TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for styling, and Redux for state management. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and key details.

## State Management

Redux is used to manage the global state of the application, including user authentication, screen management, and content browsing.

- Auth Slice: Manages user login, signup, and authentication state
- User Slice: Manages user profile and screen limit state
- Content Slice: Manages movie and TV show data
- Shop Slice Manages products and categories

## Screen Limit

Each user is limited to a maximum of 5 screens. This is managed in the User Slice of the Redux store. If a user tries to add more than 5 screens, they will be notified and prevented from doing so.
